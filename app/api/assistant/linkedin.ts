Summary
I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience working
with cross-functional agile teams to build accessible and highly
responsive modern frontend clients for mobile and web using
React.js, TypeScript, HTML, Tailwind, CSS, and JavaScript
technologies. I led a cross-functional team of 2 QA specialists, 1 UI/
UX designer, and 2 project managers to build vendor pages across a
4-week sprint for over 38 enterprise customers serving over 180,000
users using designs from Figma design board, API integrations, and
business data points from Contentful CMS
I hold a degree in Information Technology from Middlesex University,
London, alongside three certifications in AWS and Microsoft
Azure public cloud platforms.  I participate in various open-source
developer community programs and engineering meetups across
the UK, including AWS's Community Builders program. I have
written technical articles for DigitalOcean, Synk, LogRocket, Okta,
Smashing Magazine, Egghead.io covering cloud DevOps services
such as AWS Lambda, Docker, AWS Terraform, Ansible, Git for CI/
CD, and AWS Cloudformation. 
I'm always looking to grow my personal and professional network.
